== Overview

`QCheck` consists of a collection of `opam` packages and extensions:

- `qcheck-core` - provides the core property-based testing API and depends only
  on `unix` and `dune`.
- `qcheck-ounit` - provides an integration layer for https://github.com/gildor478/ounit[`OUnit`]
- `qcheck-alcotest` - provides an integration layer for https://github.com/mirage/alcotest[`alcotest`]
- `qcheck` - provides a compatibility API with older versions of `qcheck`,
  using both `qcheck-core` and `qcheck-ounit`.
- `ppx_deriving_qcheck` - provides a preprocessor to automatically derive
   generators

In addition, the https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicoretests[`multicoretests`]
repository offers

- `qcheck-stm` - for running sequential and parallel model-based tests
- `qcheck-lin` - for testing an API for sequential consistency
- `qcheck-multicoretests-util` - a small library of utility extensions, such as
  properties with time outs

To construct advanced random generators, the following libraries might also be
of interest:

- https://gitlab.inria.fr/fpottier/feat/[`feat`] - a library for functional
  enumeration and sampling of algebraic data types
- https://github.com/gasche/random-generator/[`random-generator`] - a library
  experimenting with APIs for random generation

Earlier `qcheck` spent some time in https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML[qtest],
but was since made standalone again.


== Documentation

The documentation for the 5 opam packages https://c-cube.github.io/qcheck/[is available here].

The section <<examples>> below offer a brief introduction to the
library. These examples are based on an earlier
https://cedeela.fr/quickcheck-for-ocaml[blog post by Simon] that also
discusses some design choices; however, be warned that the API changed
since then, so the blog post code will not work as is.

Jan's http://janmidtgaard.dk/quickcheck/index.html[course material on
 FP and property-based testing] also offers an introduction to QCheck.

The OCaml textbook from Cornell University also contains
https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/correctness/randomized.html[a
chapter about property-based testing with QCheck].


== Build and Install

You can install QCheck via `opam`:

    $ opam install qcheck-core

This provides a minimal installation without needless dependencies.

Install the bigger `qcheck` package instead for compatibility with qcheck.0.8
and before:

    $ opam install qcheck

To build the library from source

    $ make

Normally, for contributors, `opam pin https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck`
will pin the 5 opam packages from this repository.


== License

The code is now released under the BSD license.

== An Introduction to the Library

First, let's see a few tests. Let's open a toplevel (e.g. utop)
and type the following to load QCheck:

[source,OCaml]
----
#require "qcheck-core";;
----

NOTE: alternatively, it is now possible to locally do: `dune utop src`
to load `qcheck`.

=== List Reverse is Involutive

We write a random test for checking that `List.rev (List.rev l) = l` for
any list `l`:

[source,OCaml]
----
let test =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000 ~name:"list_rev_is_involutive"
   QCheck.(list small_nat)
   (fun l -> List.rev (List.rev l) = l);;

(* we can check right now the property... *)
QCheck.Test.check_exn test;;
----


In the above example, we applied the combinator `list` to
the random generator `small_nat` (ints between 0 and 100), to create a
new generator of lists of random integers. These builtin generators
come with printers and shrinkers which are handy for outputting and
minimizing a counterexample when a test fails.

Consider the buggy property `List.rev l = l`:

[source,OCaml]
----
let test =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000 ~name:"my_buggy_test"
   QCheck.(list small_nat)
   (fun l -> List.rev l = l);;
----

When we run this test we are presented with a counterexample:

[source,OCaml]
----
# QCheck.Test.check_exn test;;
Exception:
test `my_buggy_test` failed on â‰¥ 1 cases: [0; 1] (after 11 shrink steps)
----

In this case QCheck found the minimal counterexample `[0;1]` to the property
`List.rev l = l` and it spent 11 steps shrinking it.


Now, let's run the buggy test with a decent runner that will print the results
nicely (the exact output will change at each run, because of the random seed):

----
# #require "qcheck-core.runner";;
# QCheck_base_runner.run_tests [test];;
random seed: 452768242

--- Failure --------------------------------------------------------------------

Test my_buggy_test failed (14 shrink steps):

[0; 1]
================================================================================
failure (1 tests failed, 0 tests errored, ran 1 tests)
- : int = 1
----

For an even nicer output `QCheck_base_runner.run_tests` also accepts an optional
parameter `~verbose:true`.


=== Mirrors and Trees

`QCheck` provides many useful combinators to write generators, especially for
recursive types, algebraic types, and tuples.

Let's see how to generate random trees:

[source,OCaml]
----
type tree = Leaf of int | Node of tree * tree

let leaf x = Leaf x
let node x y = Node (x,y)

let tree_gen = QCheck.Gen.(sized @@ fix
  (fun self n -> match n with
    | 0 -> map leaf nat
    | n ->
      frequency
        [1, map leaf nat;
         2, map2 node (self (n/2)) (self (n/2))]
    ));;

(* generate a few trees, just to check what they look like: *)
QCheck.Gen.generate ~n:20 tree_gen;;

let arbitrary_tree =
  let open QCheck.Iter in
  let rec print_tree = function
    | Leaf i -> "Leaf " ^ (string_of_int i)
    | Node (a,b) -> "Node (" ^ (print_tree a) ^ "," ^ (print_tree b) ^ ")"
  in
  let rec shrink_tree = function
    | Leaf i -> QCheck.Shrink.int i >|= leaf
    | Node (a,b) ->
      of_list [a;b]
      <+>
      (shrink_tree a >|= fun a' -> node a' b)
      <+>
      (shrink_tree b >|= fun b' -> node a b')
  in
  QCheck.make tree_gen ~print:print_tree ~shrink:shrink_tree;;
----

Here we write a generator of random trees, `tree_gen`, using
the `fix` combinator. `fix` is *sized* (it is a function from `int` to
a random generator; in particular for size 0 it returns only leaves).
The `sized` combinator first generates a random size, and then applies
its argument to this size.

Other combinators include monadic abstraction, lifting functions,
generation of lists, arrays, and a choice function.

Then, we define `arbitrary_tree`, a `tree QCheck.arbitrary` value, which
contains everything needed for testing on trees:

- a random generator (mandatory), weighted with `frequency` to
  increase the chance of generating deep trees
- a printer (optional), very useful for printing counterexamples
- a *shrinker* (optional), very useful for trying to reduce big
  counterexamples to small counterexamples that are usually
  more easy to understand.

The above shrinker strategy is to

- reduce the integer leaves, and
- substitute an internal `Node` with either of its subtrees or
  by splicing in a recursively shrunk subtree.

A range of combinators in `QCheck.Shrink` and `QCheck.Iter` are available
for building shrinking functions.


We can write a failing test using this generator to see the
printer and shrinker in action:

[source,OCaml]
----
let rec mirror_tree (t:tree) : tree = match t with
  | Leaf _ -> t
  | Node (a,b) -> node (mirror_tree b) (mirror_tree a);;

let test_buggy =
  QCheck.Test.make ~name:"buggy_mirror" ~count:200
    arbitrary_tree (fun t -> t = mirror_tree t);;

QCheck_base_runner.run_tests [test_buggy];;
----

This test fails with:

[source,OCaml]
----

--- Failure --------------------------------------------------------------------

Test mirror_buggy failed (6 shrink steps):

Node (Leaf 0,Leaf 1)
================================================================================
failure (1 tests failed, 0 tests errored, ran 1 tests)
- : int = 1
----


With the (new found) understanding that mirroring a tree
changes its structure, we can formulate another property
that involves sequentializing its elements in a traversal:

[source,OCaml]
----
let tree_infix (t:tree): int list =
  let rec aux acc t = match t with
    | Leaf i -> i :: acc
    | Node (a,b) ->
      aux (aux acc b) a
  in
  aux [] t;;

let test_mirror =
  QCheck.Test.make ~name:"mirror_tree" ~count:200
    arbitrary_tree
    (fun t -> List.rev (tree_infix t) = tree_infix (mirror_tree t));;

QCheck_base_runner.run_tests [test_mirror];;
----


=== Integrated shrinking with `QCheck2`

You may have noticed the `shrink_tree` function above to reduce tree
counterexamples. With the newer `QCheck2` module, this is not needed
as shrinking is built into its generators.

For example, we can rewrite the above tree generator to `QCheck2` by just
changing the `QCheck` occurrences to `QCheck2`:

[source,OCaml]
----
type tree = Leaf of int | Node of tree * tree

let leaf x = Leaf x
let node x y = Node (x,y)

let tree_gen = QCheck2.Gen.(sized @@ fix
  (fun self n -> match n with
    | 0 -> map leaf nat
    | n ->
      frequency
        [1, map leaf nat;
         2, map2 node (self (n/2)) (self (n/2))]
    ));;

(* generate a few trees with QCheck2, just to check what they look like: *)
QCheck2.Gen.generate ~n:20 tree_gen;;
----


`QCheck2.Test.make` has a slightly different API than `QCheck.Test.make`,
in that it accepts an optional `~print` argument and consumes generators
directly built with `QCheck2.Gen`:

[source,OCaml]
----
let rec print_tree = function
  | Leaf i -> "Leaf " ^ (string_of_int i)
  | Node (a,b) -> "Node (" ^ (print_tree a) ^ "," ^ (print_tree b) ^ ")";;

let rec mirror_tree (t:tree) : tree = match t with
  | Leaf _ -> t
  | Node (a,b) -> node (mirror_tree b) (mirror_tree a);;

let test_buggy =
  QCheck2.Test.make ~name:"buggy_mirror" ~count:200 ~print:print_tree
    tree_gen (fun t -> t = mirror_tree t);;

QCheck_base_runner.run_tests [test_buggy];;
----

Being newer the `QCheck2` module is less battle tested than `QCheck`.
`QCheck2` on the other hand removes the need for having to hand-write shrinkers.
`QCheck` tests can be ported to `QCheck2` by following the
https://c-cube.github.io/qcheck/dev/qcheck-core/QCheck2/index.html#migration_qcheck2[migration guide].
Please file an issue if you encounter problems using either of the two modules.


=== Preconditions

The functions `QCheck.assume` and `QCheck.(==>)` can be used for
tests with preconditions.
For instance, `List.hd l :: List.tl l = l` only holds for non-empty lists.
Without the precondition, the property is false and will even raise
an exception in some cases.

[source,OCaml]
----
let test_hd_tl =
  QCheck.(Test.make
    (list int) (fun l ->
      assume (l <> []);
      l = List.hd l :: List.tl l));;

QCheck_base_runner.run_tests [test_hd_tl];;
----

By including a precondition QCheck will only run a property on input
satisfying `assume`'s condition, potentially generating extra test inputs.


=== Long tests

It is often useful to have two version of a testsuite: a short one that runs
reasonably fast (so that it is effectively run each time a project is built),
and a long one that might be more exhaustive (but whose running time makes it
impossible to run at each build). To that end, each test has a 'long' version.
In the long version of a test, the number of tests to run is multiplied by
the `~long_factor` argument of `QCheck.Test.make`.


=== Runners

The module `QCheck_base_runner` defines several functions to run tests.
The easiest one is probably `run_tests`, but if you write your tests in
a separate executable you can also use `run_tests_main` which parses
command line arguments and exits with `0` in case of success,
or an error number otherwise.

The module `QCheck_runner` from the `qcheck` opam package is similar, and
includes compatibility with `OUnit`.


=== Integration within OUnit

https://github.com/gildor478/ounit[OUnit] is a popular unit-testing framework
for OCaml.
QCheck provides a sub-library `qcheck-ounit` with some helpers, in `QCheck_ounit`,
to convert its random tests into OUnit tests that can be part of a wider
test-suite.

[source,OCaml]
----
let passing =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000
    ~name:"list_rev_is_involutive"
    QCheck.(list small_nat)
    (fun l -> List.rev (List.rev l) = l);;

let failing =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:10
    ~name:"fail_sort_id"
    QCheck.(list small_nat)
    (fun l -> l = List.sort compare l);;

let _ =
  let open OUnit in
  run_test_tt_main
    ("tests" >:::
       List.map QCheck_ounit.to_ounit_test [passing; failing])
----


=== Integration within alcotest

https://github.com/mirage/alcotest/[Alcotest] is a simple and colorful test framework for
OCaml. QCheck now provides a sub-library `qcheck-alcotest` to
easily integrate into an alcotest test suite:

[source,OCaml]
----

let passing =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000
    ~name:"list_rev_is_involutive"
    QCheck.(list small_int)
    (fun l -> List.rev (List.rev l) = l);;

let failing =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:10
    ~name:"fail_sort_id"
    QCheck.(list small_int)
    (fun l -> l = List.sort compare l);;

let () =
  let suite =
    List.map QCheck_alcotest.to_alcotest
      [ passing; failing]
  in
  Alcotest.run "my test" [
    "suite", suite
  ]
----


=== Integration within Rely

https://reason-native.com/docs/rely/[Rely] is a Jest-inspire native reason
testing framework. @reason-native/qcheck-rely is available via NPM and provides
matchers for the easy use of qCheck within Rely.

[source, Reason]
----
open TestFramework;
open QCheckRely;

let {describe} = extendDescribe(QCheckRely.Matchers.matchers);

describe("qcheck-rely", ({test}) => {
  test("passing test", ({expect}) => {
    let passing =
      QCheck.Test.make(
        ~count=1000,
        ~name="list_rev_is_involutive",
        QCheck.(list(small_int)),
        l =>
        List.rev(List.rev(l)) == l
      );
    expect.ext.qCheckTest(passing);
    ();
  });
  test("failing test", ({expect}) => {
    let failing =
      QCheck.Test.make(
        ~count=10, ~name="fail_sort_id", QCheck.(list(small_int)), l =>
        l == List.sort(compare, l)
      );

    expect.ext.qCheckTest(failing);
    ();
  });
});

----


=== Deriving generators

The `ppx_deriving_qcheck` opam package provides a ppx_deriver to derive QCheck
generators from a type declaration:

[source,OCaml]
----
type tree = Leaf of int | Node of tree * tree
[@@deriving qcheck]
----

See the according https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/tree/master/src/ppx_deriving_qcheck/[README]
for more information and examples.


=== Usage from dune

We can use the buggy test from above using the `qcheck-core` opam package:

[source,OCaml]
----
(* test.ml *)
let test =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000 ~name:"my_buggy_test"
   QCheck.(list small_nat)
   (fun l -> List.rev l = l)

let _ = QCheck_base_runner.run_tests_main [test]
----

with the following `dune` file (note the `qcheck-core.runner` sub-package):

[source,lisp]
----
(test
 (name test)
 (modules test)
 (libraries qcheck-core qcheck-core.runner)
)
----

and run it with `dune exec ./test.exe` or `dune runtest`.

We recommend using the `qcheck-core` package as it has a minimal set of
dependencies and also avoids problems with using
`(implicit_transitive_deps false)` in dune.

To instead use the `qcheck` opam package and its included `QCheck_runner`:

[source,OCaml]
----
(* test.ml *)
let test =
  QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000 ~name:"my_buggy_test"
   QCheck.(list small_nat)
   (fun l -> List.rev l = l)

let _ = QCheck_runner.run_tests_main [test]
----

with the following `dune` file:

[source,lisp]
----
(test
 (name test)
 (modules test)
 (libraries qcheck)
)
----
