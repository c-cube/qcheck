(** {1 QuickCheck-inspired property-based testing} *)

(** {1 Introduction}

    This library takes inspiration from Haskell's QuickCheck library. The
    rough idea is that the programmer describes invariants that values of
    a certain type need to satisfy ("properties"), as functions from this type
    to bool. They also need to describe how to generate random values of the type,
    so that the property is tried and checked on a number of random instances.

    This explains the organization of this module:

    - {!Gen} is used to describe how to generate random values.
      Auxiliary module {!Print} can be used along with {!Test.make}
      to build one's own generator instances.

    - {!Test} is used to describe a single test, that is, a property of
      type ['a -> bool] combined with an ['a Gen.t] that is used to generate
      the test cases for this property. Optional parameters
      allow to specify the random generator state, number of instances to generate
      and test, etc.

    💡 If you are migrating from QCheck, check the {{!section:migration_qcheck2} migration guide} below.

    {1 Examples}

    - "{!List.rev} is involutive" (the test passes so [check_exn] returns [()]):

    {[
      let test =
        QCheck2.(Test.make ~count:1000
                  ~print:Print.(list int)

                  (fun l -> List.rev (List.rev l) = l));;

      QCheck2.Test.check_exn test;;
    ]}

    - "All lists are sorted" (false property that will fail):
      {ul
        {- QCheck tests this property on random lists and finds a counter-example}
        {- QCheck then looks for the smallest counter-example possible (here [[1; 0]])
           to help you find the problem (called "shrinking")}
      }

    {[
      let test = QCheck2.(
          Test.make
            ~name:"All lists are sorted"
            ~count:10_000
            ~print:Print.(list int)
            Gen.(list nat_small)
            (fun l -> l = List.sort compare l));;

      QCheck2.Test.check_exn test;;

      Exception:
        test `All lists are sorted` failed on ≥ 1 cases:
        [1; 0] (after 5 shrink steps)

(** A tree represents a generated value and its successive shrunk values. *)
module Tree : sig
  (** Conceptually a pseudo-randomly generated value is packaged with its shrunk values.
      This coupling - called "integrated shrinking" - in a single type has a major benefit:
      most generators get shrinking "for free" by composing from smaller generators, and shrinking
      does not break invariants (e.g. shrinks of a positive number are always positive).
  *)

  type 'a t
  (** A tree of random generated values, where the root contains the value used for the test,
      and the sub-trees contain shrunk values (as trees, to be able to shrink several times a value)

      pretty-print formatter [ppf]. Values of type ['a] will be printed using the given
      pretty-printer [pp_a].

      As a tree [t] can be potentially huge when fully evaluated, you can control the maximum
      depth the printer goes with [depth].
      - [None] means "everything"

  val make_primitive : gen : (Random.State.t -> 'a) -> shrink : ('a -> 'a Seq.t) -> 'a t

      and a function [shrink] that, given a value [a], returns a lazy list of
      "smaller" values (used when a test fails).

      This lower-level function is meant to build generators for "primitive" types that can neither be
      built with other primitive generators nor through composition, or to have more control on the
      shrinking steps.

      [shrink] must obey the following rules (for your own definition of "small"):
      - [shrink a = Seq.empty] when [a] is the smallest possible value
      - [shrink a] must return values strictly smaller than [a], ideally from smallest to largest (for
        faster shrinking)
      - [let rec loop a = match shrink a () with | Nil -> () | Cons (smaller_a, _) -> loop smaller_a]
        must end for all values [a] of type ['a] (i.e. there must not be an infinite number of shrinking
        steps).

      ⚠️ This is an unstable API as it partially exposes the implementation. In particular, the type of
      [Random.State.t] may very well change in a future version, e.g. if QCheck switches to another
      randomness library.

      generators, when shrinking values

      @since 0.8

      @deprecated is this function still useful? I feel like it is either useless (invariants
      should already be part of the shrinking logic, not be added later) or a special,
      incomplete case of {!Gen.t} being an Alternative (not implemented yet). For now we
      keep it and wait for users feedback (hence deprecation to raise attention).

  (** {2:composing_generators Composing generators}

      QCheck generators compose well: it means one can easily craft generators for new values
      or types from existing generators.

      Part of the following documentation is greatly inspired by Gabriel Scherer's excellent
      {{:http://gasche.github.io/random-generator/doc/Generator.html } Generator} module documentation.

      {3 Functor}

      [Gen.t] is a functor (in the Haskell sense of "mappable"): it has a [map] function to transform a generator of ['a] into a generator of ['b],
      given a simple function ['a -> 'b].

      {[
        let even_gen : int Gen.t = Gen.map (fun n -> n * 2) Gen.int

        let odd_gen : int Gen.t = Gen.map (fun n -> n * 2 + 1) Gen.int

        let lower_case_string_gen : string Gen.t = Gen.map String.lowercase Gen.string_printable

        type foo = Foo of string * int
        let foo_gen : foo Gen.t =
          Gen.map (fun (s, n) -> Foo (s, n)) Gen.(pair string_printable int)
      ]}

      {3 Applicative}

      [Gen.t] is applicative: it has a [map2] function to apply a function of 2 (or more) arguments to 2 (or more) generators.

      Another equivalent way to look at it is that it has an [ap] function to apply a generator of
      functions to a generator of values. While at first sight this may look almost useless, it actually
      permits a nice syntax (using the operator alias [<*>]) for functions of any number of arguments.

      {[
        (* Notice that this looks suspiciously like the [foo] example above:
           this is no coincidence! [pair] is a special case of [map2] where
           the function wraps arguments in a tuple. *)
        type foo = Foo of string * int
        let foo_gen : foo Gen.t =
          Gen.map2 (fun s n -> Foo (s, n)) Gen.string_printable Gen.int

        let string_prefixed_with_keyword_gen : string Gen.t =
          Gen.map2 (fun prefix s -> prefix ^ s)
            (Gen.oneof_l ["foo"; "bar"; "baz"])
            Gen.string_printable
      ]}

      Applicatives are useful when you need several random values to build a new generator,
      {b and the values are unrelated}. A good rule of thumb is: if the values could be generated
      in parallel, then you can use an applicative function to combine those generators.

      Note that while [map2] and [map3] are provided, you can use functions with more than 3
      arguments (and that is where the [<*>] operator alias really shines):

      {[
        val complex_function : bool -> string -> int -> string -> int64 -> some_big_type

        (* Verbose version, using map3 and ap *)
        let big_type_gen : some_big_type Gen.t = Gen.(
            ap (
              ap (
                map3 complex_function
                  bool
                  string_printable
                  int)
                string_printable)
              int64)

        (* Sleeker syntax, using operators aliases for map and ap *)
        let big_type_gen : some_big_type Gen.t = Gen.(
            complex_function
            <$> bool
            <*> string_printable
            <*> int
            <*> string_printable
            <*> int64)
      ]}

      {3 Monad}

      [Gen.t] is a monad: it has a [bind] function to return a {b generator} (not a value)
      based on {b another generated value}.

      As an example, imagine you want to create a generator of [(int, string) result] that is
      an [Ok] 90% of the time and an [Error] 10% of the time. You can generate a number between
      0 and 9 and return a generator of [int] (wrapped in an [Ok] using [map]) if the generated number is
      lower than 9, otherwise return a generator of [string] (wrapped in an [Error] using [map]):
      {[
        let int_string_result : (int, string) result Gen.t = Gen.(
            bind (int_range 0 9) (fun n ->
                if n < 9
                then map Result.ok int
                else map Result.error string_printable))

        (* Alternative syntax with operators *)
        let int_string_result : (int, string) result Gen.t = Gen.(
            int_range 0 9 >>= fun n ->
            if n < 9
            then int >|= Result.ok
            else string_printable >|= Result.error)

        (* Another allternative syntax with OCaml 4.08+ binding operators *)
        let int_string_result : (int, string) result Gen.t = Gen.(
            let* n = int_range 0 9 in
            if n < 9
            then int >|= Result.ok
            else string_printable >|= Result.error)
      ]}

      Note that this particular use case can be simplified by using [frequency]:
      {[
        let int_string_result : (int, string) result Gen.t = Gen.(
            frequency [
              (9, int >|= Result.ok);
              (1, string_printable >|= Result.error)
            ])
      ]}

(** {1:migration_qcheck2 Migration to QCheck2}

    QCheck2 is a major release and as such, there are (as few as possible)
    breaking changes, as well as functional changes you should be aware of.

    {2 Minimal changes}

    Most of your QCheck (v1) code should be able to compile and run the first time you upgrade
    your QCheck version to a QCheck2-compatible version. However you may need to do the
    following minimal changes:
    - {!QCheck.Test.make} return type was changed to {!QCheck2.Test.t} to be able to run
      both QCheck and QCheck2 tests together. This is transparent if you used type inference,
      but if you explicitly used {!QCheck.Test.t} you will need to change it to {!QCheck2.Test.t}.

    {2 Recommended changes}
    Now you want to actually start using the QCheck2 features (most importantly: free shrinking!).
    To get started, change all your {!QCheck} references to {!QCheck2} and follow the compiler errors.
    Below are the most common situations you may encounter:
    - as shrinking is now integrated, several function arguments like [~shrink] or [~rev] have been removed: you
      can remove such reverse functions, they will no longer be necessary.
    - accessor functions like {!QCheck.gen} have been renamed to consistent names like {!get_gen}.
    - {!QCheck.map_keep_input} has been removed: you can use {!map} directly.
    - {!Gen.t} is no longer public, it is now abstract: it is recommended to use
      {{!section:Gen.composing_generators} generator composition} to make generators. {!Gen.make_primitive}
      was added to create generators with finer control (in particular of shrinking).
